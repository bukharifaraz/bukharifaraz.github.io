<h3>Important Terms used in Reinforcement Learning:</h3>

<ol>
<li><b>Agent</b>
  <p>
     Agent is the "decision-maker" while solving a sequential decision making problem. It can also be called "learner" i.e. the one who learns to make sequential decisions. 
  </p>
</li>



<li><b>Environment</b>
  <p>
     The world with which the agent interacts.
  </p>
</li>


<li><b>State (s)</b>
  <p>
     The current situation of the agent/environment.
  </p>
</li>



<li><b>Action (a)</b>
  <p>
    The move the agent chooses.
  </p>
</li>





<li><b>Reward (r)</b>
  <p>
      Feedback signal for the agent’s action.
  </p>
</li>




<li><b>Policy (\pi)</b>
  <p>
     The strategy the agent uses to decide actions.
  </p>
</li>





<li><b>Trajectory</b>
  <p>
     A sequence of states, actions, and rewards.
  </p>
</li>

<h3>Interaction Cycle</h3>
<p>
Loop:
    Observe state \(s_t\)
    Choose action (a_t) based on policy π(s_t)
    Receive reward (r_t) and next state (s_{t+1}) from the environment
    Update policy to improve future decisions
