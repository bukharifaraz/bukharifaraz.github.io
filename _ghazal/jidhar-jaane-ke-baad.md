<br>
जाओ हमको याद रखना तुम मगर जाने के बाद !!<br>
यूँ न हो सब भूल जाओ बन-संवर जाने के बाद !!<br>
.<br>
हम अभी तो क्या करें तुमसे बहस, ख़ुद देखना ;<br>
इन सितारों की सियाही तुम शरर जाने के बाद !!<br>
.<br>
ताक़ पर जो रख दिया था इक दिया उम्मीद का ;<br>
बस वही जलता मिला तूफ़ां गुज़र जाने के बाद !!<br>
.<br>
उज़्र वह भी दे सका वादा-ख़िलाफ़ी का नहीं ; <br>
और मैं भी चुप रहा उसके मुकर जाने के बाद !!<br>
.<br>
गर नहीं है नाम में कुछ आप ही फिर सुर्ख़-रु ;<br>
क्यों हुए ये ग़लतियाँ दो बार कर जाने के बाद!!<br>
.<br>
क़ैद में वह डोर की ख़ुद-सर गले का हार थे ;<br>
हैं पड़े क़दमों के नीचे गुल  बिखर जाने के बाद !!<br>
.<br>
कहकशाएँ क्या पता फिर ज़िन्दग़ी की खोज में  ;<br>
दर-बदर कब तक फिरें हम सब के मर जाने के बाद !!<br>
.<br>
काश ले कर कोई हमको उस तरफ़ जाए फ़राज़ ;<br>
फिर नयी मंज़िल न ढूंढें हम जिधर जाने के बाद !!  <br>
.<br>

<h3>
Translation:
</h3>
Go, but remember me after I'm gone! <br>
I hope you don't forget everything once you move on and adorn yourself again!
<h3>
Explanation:
</h3>
The poet implores the listener (perhaps a lover or a close friend) to remember them after parting ways. There's a concern that once life becomes beautiful again, the memory of their shared moments might fade.



<h3>
Translation:
</h3>
I won't argue with you right now—just wait and see; <br>
You'll witness the darkness of these stars after their sparks have gone!
<h3>
Explanation:
</h3>
The speaker chooses not to debate presently, but subtly suggests that, in time, the other person will see the reality (symbolized by the "darkness of stars" after the brilliance of sparks fades). The transient nature of the spark (momentary brightness) is contrasted with the lasting darkness (reality).




<h3>
Translation:
</h3>
The lamp of hope that was placed on the shelf;<br>
It was the only thing still burning after the storm had passed!
<h3>
Explanation:
</h3>
This couplet metaphorically speaks of a "lamp of hope" that endures even after life's storms. The storm represents hardship, but the enduring hope (despite being put aside) keeps burning.




<h3>
Translation:
</h3>
He couldn't even offer an excuse for breaking his promise; <br>
And I, too, stayed silent after he denied it!
<h3>
Explanation:
</h3>
The poet expresses a sense of resignation. The other person did not even bother to justify breaking their promise, and the poet, instead of confronting them, remained silent—suggesting either hurt or a stoic acceptance.




<h3>
Translation:
</h3>
If name doesn't matter, why was it the case that only you go the glory <br>
(even though) you had erred twice !!
<h3>
Explanation:
</h3>
 If personal reputation, fame, or recognition isn’t important, then why do they keep receiving praise or "glory".  The second line emphasizes the contradiction: the person being addressed has made the same mistake twice (possibly referencing betrayal, broken promises, or faults), yet they are the ones getting all the recognition despite their errors. The speaker is calling out the unfairness and double standards where the other’s mistakes are overlooked, while still receiving admiration. <br>

This couplet exposes hypocrisy, where someone who claims not to care about fame still benefits from it, despite repeatedly making mistakes. There's also a hint of frustration and perhaps a sense of injustice on the speaker’s part.




<h3>
Translation:
</h3>
In captivity, those were  a necklace around a stubborn  neck; <br>
Now, flowers lie scattered under the feet after they've parted!!
<h3>
Explanation:
</h3>
The core idea here contrasts the value of something (perhaps a relationship or an attachment) when confined versus when it is freed. The emphasis is on how freedom has rendered something (flowers, representing beauty or affection) worthless.<br>




<h3>
Translation:
</h3>
Who knows where the galaxies are in search of life; <br>
How long will we wander aimlessly after everyone is gone?
<h3>
Explanation:
</h3>
This couplet reflects existential questions—wondering about the search for meaning ("galaxies in search of life") and the endless wandering that may follow once everyone has passed away. There's a sense of aimless searching even beyond life.




<h3>
Translation:
</h3>
Go, but remember me after I'm gone! <br>
I hope you don't forget everything once you move on and adorn yourself again!
<h3>
Explanation:
</h3>
The poet implores the listener (perhaps a lover or a close friend) to remember them after parting ways. There's a concern that once life becomes beautiful again, the memory of their shared moments might fade.




<h3>
Translation:
</h3>
If only someone would take me in that direction, Faraz; <br>
So I don’t have to search for a new destination once I get there!
<h3>
Explanation:
</h3>
Here, the poet wishes for a guide (perhaps a spiritual or emotional guide) to lead them towards a destination where no further searching is required. It's a plea for finality, peace, and an end to constant searching for meaning.
